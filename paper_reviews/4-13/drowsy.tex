\section*{Key Ideas}
These researchers seek to lower the power consumption of microprocessors. They
target on-chip caches, which consume a large amount of power, for improvement.
They seek to exploit locality to reduce power consumption by ``dimming'' areas
of the cache that are not being heavily accessed. They claim to reduce the total
energy consumed by caches by 50-75\% with no more than a 1\% decrease in
performance.

\section*{Review}
The claim made in their abstract is very impressive. 50-75\% is a large energy
savings with such a small impact to performance. But they do not state the
impact this will have on the energy consumption of the entire system. If making
the caches more energy efficient has only a marginal effect on the overall
energy consumption of the computer, then the work is not very useful.
