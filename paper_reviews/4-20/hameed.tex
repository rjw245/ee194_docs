\section*{Key Ideas}
The paper seeks to explore how specialization can benefit a chip multiprocessor
(CMP) in terms of performance and power consumption. It is generally known that a
specially-designed ASIC will outperform a CMP in these areas, but the paper aims
to point out exactly why, in an effort to appropriate the most beneficial
characteristics for new CMP designs. They use H.264 video encoding as their
primary application for demonstration. H.264 video encoding is something which
is typically carried out by an ASIC rather than a general-purpose processor
because the ASIC ends up being much better in all respects (power, area, and
performance). They begin with an implementation of H.264 on a general processor
that lags behind the ASIC drastically. They gradually apply improvements to the
CMP which incorporate aspects of the ASIC to improve performance and
resource consumption of the CMP. They conclude that reducing the energy cost of
CMPs is difficult, as energy overhead will tend to dominate.

\section*{Review}
I believe they selected an appropriate application for testing, since H.264
video encoding is today widely implemented using hardware acceleration.
